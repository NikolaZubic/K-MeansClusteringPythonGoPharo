# K-MeansClusteringPythonGoPharo
Serial and parallel implementation of k-means clustering vector quantization method in Python and Go, and visualization in Pharo.

## Problem description and motivation for parallel aproach 
k-Means clustering is an <b>unsupervised</b> machine learning algorithm that finds a fixed number (k) of clusters in a set of data. A <b>cluster</b> is a group of data points that are organized together due to similarities in their input features. When using a K-Means algorithm, a cluster is defined by a <b>centroid</b>, which is a point at the center of a cluster. Every point in a data set is part of the cluster whose centroid is most closely located. So, k-Means finds k number of centroids, and then assigns all data points to the closest cluster, with the aim of keeping the centroids small (we tend to minimize the distance between points in one cluster, so that they make compact ensemble and to maximize distance between different clusters).<br>
Given a set of observations (x1, x2, ..., xn), where each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to partition the n observations into k (â‰¤ n) sets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sk} so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. Formally, the objective is to find:
